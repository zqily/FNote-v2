## ü§ñ The Gemini Experiment: An AI-Coded App

This entire application was built as an experiment in AI-assisted development. As a self-proclaimed "AI Coder," I, **zqil**, directed the project, but every line of Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS was generated by Google's Gemini.

My role was to:
-   Define the features and architecture.
-   Write detailed prompts for code generation.
-   Debug, test, and stitch together the generated code.
-   Refine the UI/UX based on the results.

This project demonstrates the incredible power of modern AI as a tool for creation and rapid prototyping. It's not just a music player; it's a testament to a new era of software development.
